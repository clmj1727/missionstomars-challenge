# Mars Web Scraping and Data Analysis

## Overview

In this project, we perform web scraping and data analysis on various Mars-related datasets, including news articles and weather data. The project is divided into two main deliverables:

1. **Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News Articles** – Extract titles and preview text of news articles related to Mars exploration.
2. **Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data** – Extract and analyze temperature and atmospheric pressure data from the Curiosity rover.

This project strengthens core skills like collecting, organizing, storing, analyzing, and visualizing data.
